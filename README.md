# Responsive Website

This project was created as an assignment in Advanced Web Production @ SMCC Fall 2017

### About the Project:

The HTML was written by my professor, Valerie Green (we were not allowed to make changes to the HTML - only allowed to create the CSS file and add the nav plugin). It is intended to mock the WordPress Genesis Framework, so we could practice using advanced CSS selectors and a jQuery nav plugin

We were given three media query breakpoints to adhere to, as well as screenshots of what the page should look like on each screen
